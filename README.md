> Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many projects, such as:

* Simple, fast routing engine.
* Powerful dependency injection container.
* Multiple backends for sessions and cache storages.
* Expressive, intuitive database Eloquent ORM.
* Database agnostic schema migrations.
* Robust background job processing.
* Real-time events broadcasting.
* Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Built With

* PHP
* HTML
* CSS + SCSS
* Javascript
